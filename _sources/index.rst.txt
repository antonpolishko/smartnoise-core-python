Differential privacy is the gold standard definition of privacy protection. The SmartNoise project aims to connect theoretical solutions from the academic community with the practical lessons learned from real-world deployments, to make differential privacy broadly accessible to future deployments. Specifically, we provide several basic building blocks that can be used by people involved with sensitive data, with implementations based on vetted and mature differential privacy research. In SmartNoise Core, we provide a pluggable open source library of differentially private algorithms and mechanisms for releasing privacy preserving queries and statistics, as well as APIs for defining an analysis and a validator for evaluating these analyses and composing the total privacy loss on a dataset.

The mechanisms library provides a fast, memory-safe native runtime for validating and running differentially private analyses. The runtime and validator are built in Rust, and bindings are made available through this python package.

Differentially private computations are specified as an analysis graph that can be validated and executed to produce differentially private releases of data. Releases include metadata about accuracy of outputs and the complete privacy cost of the analysis.
